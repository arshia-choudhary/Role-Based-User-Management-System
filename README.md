Role based user management system using file handling in python.
# Role Based User Management System

This project is a Python program that manages users with different roles: **Admin, Faculty, and Student**.  
The system uses simple text files (`user.txt` and `marks.txt`) to store data about users and their marks.

## How to Run
1. Save the code in a Python file (example: `main.py`).
2. Make sure `user.txt` and `marks.txt` exist in the same folder (create empty files if not).
3. Run the program:
 ```bash
 python main.py
Choose Signup or Login from the menu and follow the steps.

Future Scope
Use a database instead of text files for better performance.

Encrypt passwords for security.

Add a simple GUI with Tkinter or a web version with Flask/Django.

ðŸ‘‰ This looks like a **studentâ€™s project README**, not AI-generated.  

Do you want me to also make a **short sample `user.txt` and `marks.txt` content** so that when someone runs it for the first time, they already have some test data?
